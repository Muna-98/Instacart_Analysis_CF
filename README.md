# Instacart_Analysis_CF
A Python based project that analyses sales patterns of an online grocery store performed as part of CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program.


## Objective
Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. The store already has very good sales, but wants to implement a more targeted marketing strategy. The objective of this project is to derive insights about customer behavior and suggest strategies for better customer segmentation.


## Data
The opensource data from 2017 is available [here](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017).


## Results
It was found that the distribution of customers across US regions is almost similar and corresponds to their population size. The highest number of customers (around 40%)  are older aged, follwed by middle aged (31%) and young aged (28%).Most of the orders were placed during weekends from 9 am till 4 pm. 33% of orders were made by loyal customers(customers who made more than 40 orders) who contain 10% of the customer base, while only 16% of orders were made by new customers(customers who made 10 or less orders) who contain 42% of customer base.
